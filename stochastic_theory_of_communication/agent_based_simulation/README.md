THEORY (THOUGHTS):

simulation of communication-control in the multiagent system (stochastic theory)

colorful_matrix_sefl-organization_of_swarm_single-to-group_entropy_and_temperature


_agents_ are not necessarily meant to be intelligent

stady of interdependat (independant) of agents --(communication, connection, sinergetics, emergence effects)--> self-organization

---

TODO:

-- scroller for temperature
-- automatic filling of state space (4 posibple values of parameter etc)
-- not permitted states according to neighbors (communication)
-- communication changes degrees of fridom

---

PRACTICAL NOTES:

Currently matplotlib is going to be used for visualization.
manim is good for formulas and mani other things, but for visualization of particles it is better to use more light tool

maybe somewhen will be used:

(stochastic communication theory) --> complex ssytems thermodynemics


for graphics mudules: PyQt, ..., in pygame there is no scrollbars
